### Description

Loads a .wav file and Processes it, seperating the chunks, and graphs it.

Basiclly just shows how to read a standard pcm .wav file manually. Coded this for a project i was working on. This code loads the complete data chunk of the waveform into memory, but could be *easly* changed to only load a few samples or seconds of data. Coded this from scratch using a couple of documents on the wav file format, as all the vb code examples i could find on here were pretty messy.

Wave data is placed in one of two UDT's either WaveData8bit_ or WaveData16bit_ and can be accessed by .ChannelData(Channel,Sample)

(btw, this is my first time posting here, sorry if i have done something 'naughty' :P)
